Node Schedule is a flexible cron-like and not-cron-like job scheduler for Node.js.
It allows you to schedule jobs (arbitrary functions) for execution at
specific dates, with optional recurrence rules. It only uses a single timer
at any given time (rather than reevaluating upcoming jobs every second/minute).
